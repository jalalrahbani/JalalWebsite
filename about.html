        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Jalal Al Rahbani, and I am a Bioinformatics Scientist and computational biologist devoted to translating intricate biological data into actionable insights. I completed dual Master’s degrees at McGill University, one in the Department of Physiology and the other in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology within the Faculty of Medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these academic pursuits, I acquired specialized knowledge in molecular and cell biology research, biochemical analysis, proteomics with a focus on post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein-interactome analysis, as well as various advanced light-microscopy fluorescent techniques spanning from basic widefield to cutting-edge super-resolution imaging techniques. My expertise includes designing and executing proteomics and quantitative imaging experiments, creating customized Python tools for data interpretation and visualization, and employing machine learning algorithms to identify significant trends within extensive biological datasets.        
        </p>
        <p>
            During my research at McGill Bellini Life Sciences complex and the RI-MUHC, I contributed to diverse projects involving live-cell imaging, sophisticated image segmentation techniques, and the integration of computational methodologies to explore cellular migration patterns and contractile forces. Some of my notable achievements include the identification of a new protein interaction linking Cdc42-GTPase Activating Protein (CdGAP) with Talin-1/2, and the revelation of a regulatory paxillin FAK1/PAK1 driven phospho-switch that influences cell protrusion and migration. I am well-versed in utilizing essential and advanced imaging and bioinformatics tools like Fiji, ImageJ, Imaris, CellProfiler, QuPath, and Scaffold. Additionally, I have experience mentoring students and serving as a teaching assistant, fostering a culture of scientific excellence and collaborative learning in laboratory and classroom environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to research, I am dedicated to effectively communicating scientific concepts. I have a talent for translating complex technical discoveries into easily understandable language, creating informative visual aids, and developing user-friendly software solutions tailored for professionals in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, health technology, and academia. Recently, I have been involved in constructing comprehensive web applications that simplify data-driven analysis and reporting processes for individuals who are not experts in the field.
        </p>    

        <h2>Technical Expertise</h2>
        <p>
            My technical toolkit includes Python (with expertise in NumPy, Pandas, scikit-image), SQL, and a wide range of bioinformatics and imaging platforms such as Fiji, ImageJ, CellProfiler, QuPath, and Imaris. I have in-depth experience developing and optimizing image-analysis pipelines and analyzing proteomics data using Scaffold. My background includes designing and automating custom computational workflows, leveraging machine learning for biological image and data analysis, and employing advanced statistical and visualization tools such as GraphPad, JMP, Power BI, Cytoscape, and STRING. In addition to desktop and scripting workflows, I design and maintain full-stack, web-based applications that make data-driven analysis and reporting easier for end users.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am proficient in both high-performance computing and cloud-based environments, with a strong focus on reproducible research and data-management best practices. I use modern development practices—version control with Git/GitHub, clear documentation, modular code, and environment management—to ensure portability and collaboration. I’m comfortable troubleshooting across operating systems and rapidly learning new tools and libraries. My experience also includes training and mentoring students and colleagues on computational and image-analysis tools, supporting collaborative research in cell biology, cancer, and neuroscience.
        </p>

        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>
            My research integrates computational biology, quantitative imaging, and molecular science, shaped by two distinct Master’s programs at McGill University:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Live-Cell Imaging & Quantitative Analysis </strong> (Department of Physiology, McGill): Specialized in advanced live-cell imaging and quantitative analysis of cellular migration and trajectory. Developed and optimized image-segmentation pipelines and computational tools for precise measurement and visualization of cell dynamics.</li>
            <li><strong>Molecular & Proteomics Research</strong> (Department of Anatomy & Cell Biology, RI-MUHC): Conducted molecular and cell biology experiments, including biochemical assays and advanced proteomics to investigate post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein–protein interactions. Applied protein-interactome analysis to explore underlying biological mechanisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Computational Tool Development:</strong> Designed and automated Python-based workflows for extracting, analyzing, and visualizing complex biological data, leveraging machine learning and statistical approaches for high-content imaging and proteomics datasets. Where appropriate, I extend these tools into web applications to streamline use and collaboration.</li>
            <li><strong>Teaching, Mentoring & Collaboration:</strong> Trained and supported students and researchers in microscopy, image analysis, and bioinformatics workflows. Promoted rigorous, reproducible science through mentorship, collaborative projects, and classroom teaching; comfortable aligning mixed technical and non-technical stakeholders around clear, decision-oriented deliverables.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Communication & Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
            I have a strong record of collaborating with multidisciplinary research teams, mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and delivering clear, impactful presentations in both lab and classroom settings. My research has been published in leading scientific journals, including Biophysical Journal and Cell Reports, and has been recognized with awards for both oral and poster presentations.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am multilingual, fluent in English and Arabic, with professional working proficiency in French and conversational skills in Spanish. My achievements include the Charles River Laboratories Fellowship for academic excellence and recognition at McGill's Physiology Graduate Research Day.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my technical expertise, I thrive in dynamic, remote, or hybrid environments and am passionate about scientific communication, reproducible research, and empowering others to leverage cutting-edge computational tools.
        </p>

        <h2>Industry & Commercial Engagement </h2>
        <p>
            I support industry-facing communication and commercial activities for pharma, biotech, and health-tech teams. This includes translating complex mechanisms into clear value messages, preparing expert-facing scientific slide decks, creating plain-language one-pagers and visual abstracts, and assembling concise competitive-landscape snapshots to inform positioning and outreach. I’m comfortable with webinars, remote demos, and structured follow-ups across time zones, and I draw on earlier direct-sales experience to guide discovery conversations, listen for needs, handle objections thoughtfully, and establish clear next steps. Open to supporting medical communications, MSL-adjacent, and commercial roles.
