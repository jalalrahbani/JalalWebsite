        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Jalal Al Rahbani, a Bioinformatics Scientist and computational biologist dedicated to transforming complex biological data into actionable insights. I hold two Master's degrees from McGill University: one from the Department of Physiology, and a second from the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, in the faculty of medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these programs, I developed deep expertise in molecular and cell biology research, biochemical analysis, proteomics especially post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein interactome data analysis and a wide array of light microscopy fluorescent techniques from simple widefield to advanced super resolution imaging. My experience extends to designing and performing quantitative imaging experiments, developing custom Python tools for data analysis and visualization, and applying machine learning to extract meaningful patterns from large biological datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my research at McGill Bellini Life Sciences complex and the RI-MUHC, I contributed to projects in live-cell imaging, advanced image segmentation, and the integration of computational workflows to study cell migration behavior and contractile forces. My direct work has led to the discovery of a novel protein interaction between Cdc42-GTPase Activating Protein (CdGAP) and Talin-1/2 as well as a regulatory paxillin FAK1/PAK1 Phospho-switch governing cell protrusion and migration. I am proficient with key imaging and bioinformatics tools such as Fiji, ImageJ, Imaris, CellProfiler, QuPath, and Scaffold. In addition, I have mentored students and served as a teaching assistant, fostering scientific rigor and collaborative learning in both lab and classroom settings.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Technical Expertise</h2>
        <p>
            My technical toolkit includes Python (with expertise in NumPy, Pandas, scikit-image), SQL, and a wide range of bioinformatics and imaging platforms, such as Fiji, ImageJ, CellProfiler, QuPath, and Imaris. I have in-depth experience developing and optimizing image analysis pipelines, as well as analyzing proteomics data using Scaffold. My background includes designing and automating custom computational workflows, leveraging machine learning for biological image and data analysis, and employing advanced statistical and visualization tools such as GraphPad, JMP, Power BI, Cytoscape, and String.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am proficient in both high-performance computing and cloud-based environments, with a strong focus on reproducible research and data management best practices. My experience also includes training and mentoring students and colleagues on computational and image analysis tools, supporting collaborative research in cell biology, cancer, and neuroscience.
        </p>

        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>
            My research integrates computational biology, quantitative imaging, and molecular science, shaped by two distinct Master's programs at McGill University:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Live Cell Imaging & Quantitative Analysis</strong> (Department of Physiology, McGill): Specialized in advanced live-cell imaging and quantitative analysis of cellular migration and trajectory. Developed and optimized image segmentation pipelines and computational tools for precise measurement and visualization of cell dynamics.</li>
            <li><strong>Molecular & Proteomics Research</strong> (Department of Anatomy & Cell Biology, RI-MUHC): Conducted molecular and cell biology experiments, including biochemical assays and advanced proteomics to investigate post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein-protein interactions. Applied protein interactome analysis to uncover novel biological mechanisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Computational Tool Development:</strong> Designed and automated Python-based workflows for extracting, analyzing, and visualizing complex biological data, leveraging machine learning and statistical approaches for high-content imaging and proteomics datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Teaching, Mentoring & Collaboration:</strong> Trained and supported students and researchers in microscopy, image analysis, and bioinformatics workflows. Promoted rigorous, reproducible science through mentorship, collaborative projects, and classroom teaching.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Communication & Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
            I have a strong record of collaborating with multidisciplinary research teams, mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and delivering clear, impactful presentations in both lab and classroom settings. My research has been published in leading scientific journals, including Biophysical Journal and Cell Reports, and has been recognized with awards for both oral and poster presentations.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am multilingual, fluent in English and Arabic, with professional working proficiency in French and conversational skills in Spanish. My achievements include the Charles River Laboratories Fellowship for academic excellence and recognition at McGill's Physiology Graduate Research Day.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my technical expertise, I thrive in dynamic, remote, or hybrid environments and am passionate about scientific communication, reproducible research, and empowering others to leverage cutting-edge computational tools.
